# Keylogger-using-Java
This project is a keylogger application built using Java and the JNativeHook library. It captures and records keystrokes in real time, demonstrating the capabilities of low-level keyboard event listening in Java.

ðŸ“€ What is a keylogger ?
A keylogger is an insidious form of spyware. You enter sensitive data onto your keyboard, believing nobody is watching. In fact, keylogging software is hard at work logging everything that you type. Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit â€“ all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals wait to make use of all this sensitive information.
